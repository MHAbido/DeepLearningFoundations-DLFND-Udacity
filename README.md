# DeepLearningFoundations-DLFND-Udacity
## Projects:

1. [First Neural Network](https://github.com/MHAbido/DeepLearningFoundations-DLFND-Udacity/tree/master/P1-First_Neural_Network): Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.

2. [Image classification](https://github.com/MHAbido/DeepLearningFoundations-DLFND-Udacity/tree/master/P2-Image_Classification): Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.

3. [Tv Script Generation](https://github.com/MHAbido/DeepLearningFoundations-DLFND-Udacity/tree/master/P3-Tv_Script_Generation): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.

4. [Language Translation](https://github.com/MHAbido/DeepLearningFoundations-DLFND-Udacity/tree/master/P4-Language_Translation): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset).

5. [Face Generation](https://github.com/MHAbido/DeepLearningFoundations-DLFND-Udacity/tree/master/P5-Face_Generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
